# ORF finding and translating to corrosponding protein sequences


1. It should be I/O of files basis - that is the program should pick the file.

2. And parse it through the fasta file and show details.

3. User should select the start codons to use.

4. i. Perform the ORF selection. NOTE: Also see the possiblity of having multiple ORF, find all the possible ORF.

ii. After that call BLAST for getting the details of the corresponding sequence.
	
iii. Finally try to point out the best ORF sequence on the basis of BLAST 
		/ OR / 
	 Conclude the BLAST result out for the user to get a clear idea about the best ORF sequence.

iv. Try to include some graphics for better understanding of the user.

5. Then translate the ORF sequence to corresponding protein sequence.
